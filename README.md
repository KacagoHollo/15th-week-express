# Login form with authorization - backend

Creating a form with the options of sign up, log in and signout.
The logged in user is able to save to-dos to his profile page.
The password is hashed, the user datas are saved to localstorage and sessionstorage.

This is the backend part of the app.

The App works perfectly with the frontend side: https://github.com/KacagoHollo/15th-week.
